## This code is a working example of a user authentication system using the GUN database.
- When a user signs in or creates an account, their username and password are stored in the GUN database for recall.
- The Passphrase the user chooses will be extended with PBKDF2 to make it a secure way to login.
- When a user logs out, their session is terminated.

# Next?
##### Working on 2FA with Barcode and Google Authenticator. Stay tuned
